I'm 24 years old and my twin sisters are 19. One sister is 8 months pregnant. They're going to be grandparents soon. We grew up in a stable home with loving parents. They rarely argued and we were always a close family.

Then 4 months ago was the shock of my life (less by now) when I read my father's secret journal. This is a summary of what his journal was about:

***My parents were dating for 3 years. Then when mom was 20, my dad caught her cheating with his best friend (literally in the act and their clothes scatterd on the floor; mom on top of him). There was an empty bottle of wine and they ate some of his food. It happened in his own house, on his couch. Dad fights/punches the hell out of the friend and breaks up. Mom starts begging, crying, promising not to ever cheat again, how she loves him, etc. He takes her back 3-4 months later, they go to couple therapy, he goes to individual counseling too and worked it out. They still get married in 1996 (4 years after she cheated) and I'm born in 1998. Dad still had his doubts (didn't fully trust her yet) and took a paternity test twice. Twice it was 99.99 positive. He put his distrust at rest but his ego was still hurt. He has a brief revenge affair for a couple weeks but then felt guilt, ends it and confesses. I was just 2 years old when dad cheated back. Mom forgives him too, they go to marriage counseling and since he confessed, the R process is quicker. They apologized to each other and dad made a permanent deal with her. The deal was that she drops the subject of his cheating and he would shut up about what she did.***

I was initially hurt over what she did to dad first but now I'm ok. Supposedly his journal does talk about her transformation. She did brought him a new couch, became a punctual person (she used to come late to meeting, their dates, etc), got into cooking, was an open book to him, gave up on the girls night out and focused on college...lastly became the person me and my sisters have known her as; a devoted wife and mother. Ironically she's been the stricter parent in the house and didn't want any of us to become wild, party girls.

So once a cheater always a cheater doesn't always applies?? Do you a cheater that got caught like that can still reform and become a better and good person???

TLDR: I read dad's journal. I learned mom got caught cheating with dad's best friend. She caused dad to cheat back in revenge years later. I've always believe once a cheater always a cheater but I don't know what to think now.

She tells me it's just a type and not to worry as there are other things about me that she really like (humble brag but I'm conventionally attractive in terms of fitness, hair and face) but it's just that I know that I'll never be good enough, like drool-worthy for her and it's really destroying my confidence.

I've been with my bf for over 9 years now. He is great, charming, funny, super polite and has many interesting hobbies. I love him and I am happy that he has many friends but more and more my self worth is starting to decline because people like him more than me...always.

Now, sure this could maybe be all in my head but presently we met new people and it really highlighted again that I am more like a ""add-on"" when it comes to my bf, like something they do not need but have to put up with if they want to hang out with him.

Just yesterday we met up with a couple we've only seen once before. They are very nice people but for me it was so obvious that they ADORE him even.

We were somewhat of an unlikely friendship, but never the less we’ve grown to have a close friendship dynamic. We’ve been emotionally there for eachother, we check each on our bullshit. Genuinely I value this friendship so highly. She’s probably one of the only people (outside of my actual family) I really get to emotionally unwind with and really just say what I think and feel with. We’ve had years of deep, sometimes really dark and emotional conversations. Helped each-other get through some hard stuff.

The trouble is, I don’t feel like it’s totally reciprocated anymore. It slowly feels like we’re growing distant and I don’t know whether to let it be or try and discuss it. 

The more time goes on, I’ve been feeling less able to talk to her and the more I feel like she’s holding back from me. 

I’ve noticed that any time we’re in a group of more than just us, my value to her immediately decreases and it’s almost like she acts like she doesn’t know me. The conversation will turn to something “she doesn’t want me to hear” and she’ll kind of shut me out (despite her already discussing same thing in frank detail.) She kinda hams up on the “girl talk” aspect even though we frequently have those discussions anyway. 

Even in group conversations with a mixed group, I can’t help but feel like she ices me out or completely guts all the rapport we already had. I feel kind of like I’m demoted to acquaintance. It made me feel like Woody when Andy got a new toy. Partly childish jealousy, I know but, I also feel like it’s my soul being rejected.

I feel like a contributing factor might be something her friend said to her. A few months back she told me that a friend told her that basically “men and women can’t be friends.” Her friend also said she thinks I’m in love with her. She begrudgingly released that last part of the conversation to me. 

This really hurt me, if I’m being entirely honest. It made me feel like I’m viewed as predatory which is something I’ve always hated the feeling of. I’ve even discussed this sentiment to her prior to this discussion.

I say I naturally gravitate to having more female friendships. I have 2 older sisters. I was raised in a single parent, all female household. I’m about as close with her as I am with my sisters. I jokingly call her my “mom.” She’s affectionately known around my household as my “uni mom.” I don’t know any other way to describe how much that’s not a thing. That’s just not my intentions. She means so much to me, I’d happily marry someone to put her possible her suspicions to rest. That’s how much I platonically love her. I just want things to go back to how they used to be. 

One of my biggest values in life is consistency and loyalty. I’ve had people who’s drifted out of my life who exhibited similar traits and warning signs. I do acknowledge I have abandonment issues I’ve been trying to work through. Normally I’d compartmentalise and invalidate these emotions but I’ve been told to stop doing that and actually address and express my emotions more.

I honestly don’t know whether I should just go with the flow, and let the bond weaken, shrivel and break or try and broach the topic with her.

someone told me today that i like the idea of being at his house since it feels more secure and at home but i never thought that before. but now that they brought that up i’m wondering if it’s true.or maybe i just think it is because they’ve put that thought into my head

Let me just get straight to the point...we haven't had sex or really been intimate in 5 months. I've tried giving him ""favors' but he doesn't want to ""finish"" because he doesn't want to make a mess which I mean after so long I just want to not even think about that and at least just be in the moment. 

He says he's stressed and I get it so I've tried to just step back but I'm worried that now at this point I almost would feel awkward if sex was ever initiated and I want us to be close in that way. 

I can live with the whole sex dilemma. I love him and I understand life gets tough. I just want to make sure we don't make this our forever situation though and can make steps to get to how we used to be .  

But my issue mainly is that that on top of the fact that I have yet to meet his mom (who lives with him), he never stays the night (he says he can't sleep at my house and is uncomfortable) , and he doesn't want to live together (he says eventually we will but in conversation has mentioned he'll be moving to an apartment in a specific area in 2 years obviously alone ). 

Has mentioned he wants to marry me. 

I think the non-sex issue  has just kind of triggered me and has made me less patient unfortunately with everything else that's been bothering and worrying me.  I haven't said much to him because other than I just want to have sex with him soon, I don't want to embarrass him and I know he's busy with work. 

As far as the other topics I've mentioned them alot but now after a few months I'm just tired of repeating when he knows what I want and he says ""we will live together one day, you will meet my mom one day and I'll try to stay the night soon"" but idk after a year of hearing it I feel like he just says it lol. No actions have been made. He says we will have sex tomorrow and it never happens so I just kind of leave it all alone now. I don't want to nag. 

He's amazing and I have never had anyone treat me so well and have been so nice to me and I'm in love with him but I find myself wanting to move forward and hoping that I just need to be patient and everything will be okay and we can make this work . I'm just a believer that actions need to match up with words and idk. I'm conflicted.

So let’s get to it. I (21F) have been worried about my (21M) boyfriend. We’ve been dating for a year. He’s a couple years clean of cigarettes, I think he quit when we were 19 going on 20 or maybe even a little before that. I started dating him after he stopped but we’ve been friends since long before that. He’s been doing so well up to this point but i’m getting worried. It’s gotten super cold where we live (midwest state) and he’s been craving nic. I mean so bad to the point where he told me straight up that he wants a juul so bad. He said he wouldn’t smoke straight up cigs, he’d smoke like a vape or something but to me, all nic is bad nic. It’s addictive, it turned him into an asshole years ago before we dated and it was effecting his relationships with everyone including his girlfriend at the time. It effected him negatively in every way and he stopped. He says he thinks he’s feeling it because it’s because it got so cold so fast. 

Now, i’ve never smoked nic. Never have, never will. Never even been tempted, honestly. I don’t see the joy in it even theoretically. I only smoke weed and I want to do shrooms one day but have never gone past weed. I don’t know what to do. I just want to tell him to not do it but I know it’s not that easy. I know this probably isn’t a big deal to some people but it is to me. He has come so far and I along with his other friends do not want to see all his hard work be thrown away. Plus, I don’t know that I can fully see him the same if he did this. I love him and I do care about him and we’ve been friends for years but, for him to throw all his hard work away would be awful. I would be severely disappointed in him and maybe even a little mad. I feel like I can’t tell him this because he said that when people say “Just don’t do it” he says it makes him want to do it more. Obviously the last thing I want to do is push him further to it. What could I say/do to make him not upset, but not want to do it either? Is there anything at all? Or do I just have to hope he’s strong enough to fight his urges? 

TL;DR : Boyfriend might start smoking nic again and might likely become an asshole.

I also have borderline personality disorder/BPD, so I’m just looking for clarification because my judgement can be fucked or I can be overly sensitive.

This morning, we had a bit of a spat in the car before he dropped me off at my family’s house before he went to work. It was 5.45AM, and I said I would ideally want to wait until 6AM before going in as I have a baby sister who may wake when I open the door. Just trying to be considerate. He started a new shift pattern today, to which he has been telling me the latest he could be there is 6.30AM, so he would have had enough time to get there (with me going to my family’s at 6AM). I tell him this and he is ADAMANT he said he had to be there by 6.15, I know for a fact he didn’t. I say this to him, we have a spat that lasts less than a minute and don’t speak the rest of the drive. I say ‘bye’ and get out the car, whereas we usually kiss/say I love you. I was pissed off 1) because it was 5.45AM and 2) I believe he was gaslighting me, I know what he said, and he was shouting at me lying about it.

Anyway, I now go on Instagram and look in my suggested follows and see he’s followed some random new girl. Upon ‘investigation’, she hasn’t followed him back, he doesn’t have her on FB, they have a couple of mutual follows (his acquaintances). While her photos aren’t suggestive or anything (and she has a boyfriend), she’s still a pretty girl and all that. I know for a fact he followed her this morning, too (call me psycho or whatever but it’s the way it is and I have my reasons).

He knows for a fact this will bother me. He obviously doesn’t know her, so why follow her? Because he knows I’ll see it and wants me to be pissed off? Or possibly an accidental follow?

I’m just not sure how to approach this before seeing him later.

At first I thought nothing much about him.
But just over the course of 2 weeks, I find myself thinking about him a lot, and constantly to impress him or spending alone time with him.
The strange part is--I don't find him physically/sexually attractive.
What I like about him is how smart and kind he is, he excels at his job, and is so helpful and gentle towards everyone at work including me.
When I learnt that he already has a girlfriend, I was disappointed, but somehow that didn't stop me from thinking about him.
Now, I'm not one to ruin other's relationship, and frankly he does not meet the basic standards that I'd want in a life partner (we have different beliefs and lifestyle).
So I don't understand why I'd be so obsessed with this person, despite not finding him physically attractive and not even wanting a relationship with him.
Is this just a simple crush that will run its course and fade over time?
Or is there something deeper to it (psychologically) that I'm just not aware of yet?
All I know is that I want to be liked by this person (I don't care for any of the other people in my new workplace), and that I'd like us to be close friends.
Is that weird or inappropriate?

For context we are both 23, got together in high school &amp; have been married for a year. Our relationship has had its ups &amp; downs like everyone’s but one issue that has never been resolved is her temper/explosiveness. I am a very passive, non confrontational person, where as my wife isn’t. She is the kind of person who will say what’s on her mind even if it hurts your feelings because its “honest”. This has led to here saying very hurtful things to me in arguments throughout our entire relationship. Im a terrible boyfriend, now husband, i dont care about her/make her/us priority, been called every name in the book, have been threatened with divorce. Stuff like this doesn’t happen all the time but when it does, it hurts really bad. She always apologizes later on or the next day, but it doesn’t make it any better.

For more context, she is chronically ill &amp; has struggled with physical &amp; mental health a lot of her life, so it feels like there is always an excuse after the apology. Bad pain day, changing meds, depression, etc. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, &amp; self harm so I am sympathetic but I never take my struggles out on others. from my pov it seems like she is okay with whatever she does as long as she can point to a cause. Recently (this is where me being non confrontational is an issue, I should have addressed this long ago) ive started to be more up front about the routine of her being hurtful &amp; apologizing later, that it isn’t okay. Not long after this she said she may be bi polar (it does run in her family) &amp; wants to be evaluated for it.

I guess where im lost is, what now? What if she is? I hate to say it but I cannot live with this routine, there is more context of course but for the sake of the post I’ll keep it short.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 2 1/2 years now and he’s my best friend. We pretty much do everything together. We’re both 23. 

Here’s some history on him and this girl according to him after I confronted him . In 2019, my boyfriend briefly dated this girl he used to work with. By brief, he says they dated for about a month and not even officially. He went and got his first tattoo with her, while she got something else tatted. (The fact that he wanted her with him when he got his first tattoo striked me as odd). He swears to God that they never slept together. Not sure why they stopped talking but he and I started dating him early 2020. They hadn’t seen or spoke to eachother at all but they follow eachother on IG and he watches every last one of her stories. I had a bad feeling and looked through his IG messages and saw he had messaged her. 

He asked her if it was her at the movies last weekend and she laughed and said yes. He asked could he call her because he had the funniest thing ti tell her and she said no because he bf was there and would get upset if he heard her on the phone with a random dude. He sent her a voice note and said that he saw her at the movies while she was with her bf. He said that he noticed they were arguing and wanted to go say what’s up but didn’t because he was also with me and he didn’t know how it would look and that he made a business decision not to say hi to avoid “stress in his life”. Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t that weird? Why message her at all just because you saw her? What would you make of this? 

My gut is telling me that he still has an interest in her but idk. Why else would he feel the need to message
Her just because he saw her? This is also the same girl he got his first tattoo with.

Today we decided to each play the video games we like (for me just sims lol) in separate room. Separate rooms really works for us because I have sensory issues and have been really just wanting a quiet environment. And he’s happy not having distractions.
  
We haven’t played our games in months, almost a year even. So it was a nice break from reality and nice feeling like I had the house to myself while he was happy in the bedroom. But it also feels a little depressing, even though I’m also happy about it.

He never annoyed me on text or was fussy when I couldn’t reply right away which I liked, and it was never weird bc of it which helps because of my job, adhd brain etc. I liked how he was easy going and sweet and laid back, he’s really smart. He’s an engineer and a project manager
on salary, high ranking and a homeowner. He was never rude to me. 

Red flagsish stuff began a couple nights ago, maybe last week when every night I saw him he was drinking 14 plus beers, and when I asked for a lime for my drink, which i didn’t rlly wanna have much of on a work night, dude says “uhhh well theyre in the medicine cabinet”
weird, so I’m all huh and he gets up and leaves the room away from the kitchen to my confusion,  returns with out limes but with a tray of cocaine (didn’t know he was huge into it) thinking I said line. not limes. i laughed at first and I knew he was playing buddies the night before at poker and figured that why it was just around. we laugh it off. 

hang again, still sweet but just incoherently drunk off a dozen beers but still cool so whatever. 
tonight we go to a concert with his friend and all night long in public in front of me these guys stopped or publicly were snorting lines of cocaine and like kind of screaming and wild. They stopped the car, or walk or left the venue to go do lines prob a dozen time and even dropping his friend off continued to while also drinking beers and driving.

She currently has a lot of struggles with depression and general mental health and can be quite cold sometimes. She always reassures me that she loves me and knows I'm here for her, but it's still rough on my mental, especially because these things were the beginning of the end of my last relationship. She also told me she doesn't want any intimacy right now, which I of course respect. Last tuesday she went to sleepover at a friends house who she used to have a fling with. She asked beforehand and since I was confident in myself and our relationship I told her to go have fun, but to message me often. She didn't message me for hours although I believe that was an honest mistake because she tends to be forgetful about stuff like that. On Thursday evening she told me that she feels really bad mentally and stuff that I wont go into further detail with, but she genuinly seems to struggle. I told her that I'll always be on her side and that I'll do anything for her. 

Friday I went to her place, we had a lot of fun and cooked together and watched some Squid Game, because she was shocked that I haven't seen it until she went to sleep. Now I did something that I'm not proud of. The guy she went to sleepover at tuesday has been struggling with depression too, so I wanted to know if she told him anything she hasn't told me, regarding if she's gonna get therapy or antidepressants and because felt iffy about their sleepover (not necissarily cheating but iffy). They did talk when she messaged me on thursday regarding her feelings and struggles. She told him that she doesn't know what love feels like, because she doesn't love herself so she doesn't know if she loves me. Well that kinda stung but I get it, it makes sense. She also felt like (at thursday) that she wasn't looking forward to/feeling happy about seeing me friday. Makes sense if she's depressed. I scrolled further though and there were 2 things that kinda got to me. At wednesday I asked her to facetime me since I felt kinda down that day and wanted to talk to her to cheer up. She messaged him something along the lines of ""yeah we can't call today, throwawayphoneabs wants to"". When I asked her on saturday after waking up if we can ft more often since we did that a lot in the beginning of our relationship she said she doesn't like it and it annoys her. She has been on ft with him a lot recently. Further down, on the 26th of october she messaged him at (I think) 10:34pm ""Can I see your abs"" which he answered with ""Can't make them out, I'm too fat, tho that's better for cuddling"". She replied ""Yes, throwawayphoneabs is so skinny and bony tho"" 

I'm fairly tolerable and we both are generally communicating about our limits and stuff like that but this was a little much for me. I genuinly do not think she is cheating on me, nor do I believe she ever would with that guy, I think she is relating a lot to him right now and needs a friend she can do that with, but both of these things genuinly hurt me. How should (If at all) I approach this?

We both were born and raised (Insert Prince of Bel-Air joke) in Germany so take that into account for any grammatical mistakes and our socialization.

Okay so I don’t really know how to start this and for one I’d really appreciate kind advice because I am not doing well and already suffer from poor mental health.

For context me F (23) and my guy friend M (23) , let’s call him Sam. have been friends for about 5 years and met in first year Uni. He’s part of the friend group and things have always been strictly platonic. I’ve never seen him in a romantic/intimate sense and never will.

He has a tendency to like girls he is friends with and gets rejected by them. I’ve had a conversation with him about this in the past and was just like “ try going for girls that you aren’t already friends with/have been friendzoned by”. He was like “ I’ve never gone for you” and I was like “yeah cos we are such good friends” etc. I’ve always made sure over the years to heavily emphasize this with “such a good friend” etc. So all was well and I really just saw him as one of the gals tbh ( I know that sounds bad but more in the sense that I trusted him). 

Anyways fast forward to last Friday night. I ended up going to town with Sam and some other friends. We got very drunk and then it ended up being just Sam and I. We order an Uber to his and I’m like allgoods I’m drunk as shit and it’s 6am, may aswell crash at his for the night (I’ve done this in the past with no problems).

I still had high energy from going out and wasn’t ready for sleep yet so was like “ why don’t we just hang out for a bit and chat”. So we both got in to bed and we’re chatting away and ended up going to sleep cuddling. Disclaimer : I cuddle all my friends whilst drunk, regardless of gender so was like allgoods. Obviously not going to do this anymore for good reason.

THEN, I woke up to Sam feeling down the side of my body, putting his hand up my shirt and touching a small bit of my under boob and he touched my ass. I was fully caught off guard by this and just completely froze. I was like if I don’t react and pretend like I’m still asleep he will hopefully stop. Thankfully he did. I still continued to pretend to sleep for awhile and then acted like I just woke up. I just tried to play it off like I had no idea and continued to hug with him so as to not make it weird/awkward. 

We then got up and had lunch with another friend.
I tried to compartmentalise my feelings about it and be like “ it’s no big deal”. But the more I think about it, the more I feel sick to my stomach, violated and anxious. Like how could someone I’ve been good friends with for 5 years violate and touch me without my consent?

I know all y’all victim blammers out there might be like well “you shouldn’t have cuddled in bed with Sam you gave him the wrong idea”. In retrospect yes I shouldn’t have cuddled him but I was drunk and he was a long term friend that I trusted so none of this behaviour was to be expected. Also cuddling does not imply “I want you to feel me up/touch me/try to sleep with me”. Not to mention even if I was interested, he should not have started feeling me up when I was passed out drunk and he should’ve asked for my consent. I googled it and non consensual touching counts as SA. I just feel super grossed out by it all and so disrespected. 

I’m having all sorts of confusion and mixed up feelings about what to do here. I thought I could act like everything is fine but I saw him at a friends birthday dinner today and that really solidified to me that I was not okay and what happened was not okay. Hugging him goodbye made me feel deeply uncomfortable.

So I’m guessing I’m just asking for a bit of advice on what to do. Should I just stop being his friend all together? How do I do that? Because he is part of the friend group, like wtf would I say to the others? And would they even believe me? Not to mention some of them are closer with him and I don’t want to lose them as friends.

This is honestly the cherry on top for the horrible year I’ve been having . Had a mental breakdown like 3 months ago and was really starting to get better. Now I feel like I’m spiraling again.

I just downloaded Reddit because I can’t breathe right now and my eyes refuse to accept what I just saw. I am in my early 20s and I live with my older sister who is also in her early 20s. We’ve been best friends all our lives, tell each other everything and love each other very much. It’s been us against the world, always. My sister has always been the prettier one, she is an extrovert and loves going out and being sexually liberated. I’ve been suffering from self esteem problems and anxiety, so I’m an introvert but I’ve been working on it and think I’ve gotten better. 

I finally got my first bf some months ago. I met him through my sister and her bf, they planned a double date. My sister didn’t want me to go for the date cause she was worried about me but I still followed her and I’m happy I did. My bf had asked me to be his gf within a week, because he had to leave for a business trip and I agreed. Since work kept him busy, we hardly talked but I was understanding. When we did talk, he always asked about my sister and she always said hi and talked to him. I didn’t think anything of it. My bf just got back and he fted me and we talked for a while, then he told me his mum is calling and he’ll call me back. I was in my sister’s room and immediately he cut the line, he called her three times. That was weird but I didn’t think anything of it. She was in the bathroom without her phone. I gave her the phone and left and when I got back to her room she was on ft with him and it was weird cause it’s been a while and he was supposed to call me back. But I didn’t wanna say anything and be weird, so I kept quiet.

This evening, my sister sprained her ankle and I’m the one that’s been taking care of her. When she fell asleep, I used her phone to take cute videos with her dog and when I opened her gallery to see them, she had a screenshot of her recent phone calls. My bfs were really frequent and I was not comfortable with that and decided to snoop through her phone. I found out that she sent him videos of herself on insta, they’ve been talking with each other frequently, a lot more than he talked to me, and on the time they were on ft today, he was asking for videos of her and she was sending. 

I haven’t been able to process this, and my head is trying to not overreact. I can’t even cry properly. I’m so confused on what to do. Should I confront her? She’s my sister and my best friend and we swore never to fight over a guy though. Should I confront her? Or him? And what will I do if it’s true? Why would she do this to me? She still has her bf and they love each other. I never thought this will ever happen to me and the one person I would talk to about this type of thing is the person that may be hurting me.

I debated posting here for a long time but I've been stressing myself out about it. 

Background: 
My girlfriend and I met in college and have been dating for about a year and a half now. We've had our ups and downs but it's mostly been great. I've even met her family and they seem to love me and i like them too. I recently moved a few hours from her back home and we try and make the drive every 2 weeks to see each other and have online dates. For a while it was going great but recently things have felt different. 

She has stopped calling me pet names, doesn't really flirt with me (and we usually do ALOT), and every time I try to go up to see her she somehow always has plans. I brought this up to her and she assures me it's just because she's stressed about having to live back at home and about finding a job, and that the timing is just inconvenient each time. I'm trying to believe and be there for her but it's hard when she suddenly drops all our usual forms of affection. Our conversations feel forced and she kind of ignores all flirtatious advances from me now. I don't think she's even said I love you unpropmpted from me first in 2 months. She hasnt made any plans for us to do anything in 2 months, not a virtual date, not even a phone call. She doesnt include me in plans with friends and seems to have an aversion towards making any plans in the future with me. The more I think about it the more I realize although I've met her family, I've never met any of her friends, and she doesn't include me in plans with them ever, though I am always inviting her to mine. She also never posts me on social media, which alone isn't a problem, but I recall in her last relationship most of her posts had her ex in them.

I brought this up to her and she has kind of been dismissive about my worries and my needs after I expressed them to her, assuring me it's due to the stresses of distance and her job search that she's been distant. And that she would try to work on her life/relationship balance. I'm trying to straddle the line between being there for her while she weathers whatever stresses shes going through and ensuring that my needs are met and I feel affection in my relationship. Ive voiced my worries multiple times and I'm afraid any more ""tough conversations"" will further strain our relationship. Any advice?

Okay me 22 F and my fiance 23 M have been together for almost 6 years.  Let me start out from the beginning we met when I was 18 and he was 19.  He had messaged me on fb asking for my snap.  The first few weeks were amazing he love bombed me like crazy but it was short lived.  Around the 3 month mark he became really stand offish.  Would yell at me everytime I did anything, kept his phone turned upside-down you know all the red flags that a person can have.  I would occasionally go through his phone at the time he was in a band so he messaged a LOT of girls asking to come to shows and to like his page.  I did express to him that it made me uncomfortable and he'd flip out making me always end up having to apologize.  Just to paint the picture correctly for the first 2 years of our relationship we lived together and had went on maybe 4 dates total because he told me he didn't have any interest in going on dates or spending time with me outside of the house.  Me not having any self esteem just took it and pulled the wall over my eyes to what is more than likely happening.  I dealt with it I worked full-time took care of all his needs he hadn't touched the laundry or dishes since we got together I treated him amazingly.  He was only my second boyfriend so my experience wasn't great and I struggled a lot with intimacy but I let him hit it every night regardless of how uncomfortable and not into i was.  Fast forward another year (so 3 years at this point) we are doing better and bought our own place we got some pets and I thought all was well.  And he proposed! He still never took me on dates or had much of any conversation with me but he wasn't mean or hateful so I thought we were doing good.  Well his work asked him if he would want to leave our state to work for a month he was excited and I was excited for him.  He left and barely talked to me.  Me being shy I even sent him some spicy pictures hoping it'd make him happy and he left me on read then later apologized saying he was ""busy"" that was the first and last nude I ever sent because it made me feel so wrong and embarrassed.  Anyways he's gone for a month and comes home and everything seems fine I got myself dressed up better than I ever have before and was excited to see him.  First thing we did was get intimate and I thought since he had been waiting so long he just couldn't wait to have it.  Well fast forward now.  We sold our place without doing our research and are stuck at the in laws but still in the process of trying to buy a house.  We also now have a little baby who brings me so much happiness and joy.  But lately he's been talking none stop about this particular coworker it's very obvious he has a crush which I suppose I can't fault him on I can't control who he finds attractive or not.   But he started bringing her up at the weirdest of times and when I met her and all his other coworkers they all seemed very standoffish towards me especially that specific coworker.  Me being paranoid snooped on his phone after seeing a tiktok saying you can see uninstalled apps.  So I used his old phone and snooped and come to find out he's had meet me, tinder, a bunch of text messaging apps (which in my opinion are 100% cheating apps)   and he downloaded tinder the day he arrived to that specific state.  He also searched up ""women in (specific state he was in), ""do women like swallowing cum"" and ""do women like being sent videos of men cumming"".  I'm so taken back by this currently he has been the best partner in the world after we had our baby he talks to me, pleasures me, we've even gone on some 1 on 1 dates together.  So I don't think he's currently cheating but I feel like I was completely lied to this entire relationship.  So I'm not proud of this but I didn't want him flipping the script so I created a fake fb with the same location of where he was at when he left for his job and sent an ""anonymous"" message to me saying she matched with my man on tinder and that she's so sorry.  I asked him to come to the room and of course all lies.  He claims he never used it and has never cheated on me.  That he was thinking about it but couldn't go through with it.  He also said he thinks about cheating from time to time but only to to fantasize.  I never EVER have even considered cheating on my partner even when he treated me like a dog I remained faithful.  And I had plenty of options I couldn't even go to the store without being cat called or looked at by other men.  And I'm not saying I'm all that but I am definitely not ugly and if I wanted to cheat I had plenty of opportunities.  But I never would of if someone hit on me especially knowing I was taken I saw that as disrespectful to my partner and didn't let them down easy.  Deep down I knew he wouldn't pay me the same respect but I refused to allow myself to think that far into it.  So now here I am with a lame part time job, no home, at HIS parents house, and completely dumbfounded.... I wanted a whole family I never wanted my kids to be in a broken home.  We were doing so good our relationship was getting better and better everyday that passed and now I feel like I'm back at square one.  I couldn't even look at him while speaking to him because now I feel so fucking insecure.  He's giving me the option to leave not sure if he's bluffing or not but I'm really considering it.  Only shitty thing is I don't trust men and can't imagine myself bringing another man around my kid for obvious reasons. Now I no longer have my own home that I could of easily afforded by myself had I of known of the cheating beforehand.  He's never going to be honest with me I know he won't.  The second I hear he slept with someone else I don't think I can mentally handle that I'm scared I'm going to hurt myself if the truth comes out.  Now having his baby I just feel so used and worn out.  Why would he do this? How could he do this? While I was at home working, keeping the house perfect, cooking him home cooked meals, making his lunch every single day, and laying out his uniform every morning, AND letting him use me every night like a damn fleshlight just so he could get off never knowing I was supposed to have pleasure too.  Yet HES the one that cheated?  I can't believe I'm in this situation and I can't believe the truth has all been revealed after he's finally becoming the man I always knew he could be.  I seriously need some help I don't know what to do.  Interest rates are expected to raise within the next year we are scheduled to see a house on Monday do I pull back? Move in with family? What's the likelihood of him pulling this shit again? And will I ever be confident and trusting ever again?  This was probably awful to read it's all over the place but it's a good example of what's going on in my head.  I'm so lost everything is jumbled I wasted what feels like the best years of my life and now I'm a used up mom with a cheating baby daddy?  I'm disgusted that I allowed myself to be treated so poorly for so long and kept his life a breeze while he went behind my back looking for other women....... I need to know what to do.

My SO calls me a bull in a China shop, which admittedly isn’t too far from the truth. And in turn he is very stubborn and likes everything just so. As background, one of things most hated by him is my apparent inability to compromise - and this is hotly debated because I do in fact give into things, it’s just that I skip the preceding argument and I go ‘yeah ok, eye roll’. He knows full well that I don’t want to chill in the house all day for example and would rather walk in the city, but I get he needs his sofa time so I don’t fuss. But he still considers I don’t compromise, which is infuriating, and whenever he eventually gives in he makes a big song and dance about it. 

Which is exactly what he did in part one of the current argument on the placement of furniture in the house. He gave in then made a fuss, and told me he would have given up sooner if I’d asked ‘nicely’ (which I thought I had, but he still saw it as a bull/ china shop situation). On to part two - we have polar opposite views on another thing, and I want to test his assertion that asking ‘nicely’ gets better results. 

Problem is - what do I say?? I’ve already explained to him WHY I think my idea is better (he disagrees), without any tone raised. I feel I’m missing something here and that he is making up a standard. I’ve asked him what he means by it but he was vague (or perhaps I just don’t get it).

His ex hated that we were “together” so she threatened him that if he continued that he wouldn’t be able to see his kids…. So to keep the peace, he started to silence 🤫 any obvious acknowledgment of me. So when he was with her visiting the kids, he wouldn’t contact me. If he did it would be secretly via email 📧.

Even his texts about a year ago, started to become cryptic - I figured incase she read his phone it might not look noticeable that we are still spending time together…. To sum it up, why can’t I either break to the connection or tell him that this isn’t good enough! At the weekends he’ll go and visit his kids and may not even contact me all weekend…. If he does, it’ll be an email and normally quite short. But Sunday evening he’ll call on his way back and I always stupidly answer like it was ok I haven’t spoken to him until now!

The day before I got a call from my mom that my brother-in-law took my (1M) nephew from my sister after getting into a heated argument, they were arguing about my sister wanting to eat a burger over a pizza he had just bought. He told my sister he was going to take his son to the thinkery museum but later on called my sister telling her “I’m going to Houston to give my son a safe place away from you”, that was around 2:30pm. My sister contacted my mom around 4pm crying because she was very hopeless thinking he will never come back and she will never see her son again, keep in mind they only have one car so she couldn’t go find them if she could. Around 5:30-6pm he arrived back home acting like he did nothing. My sister contacted my mom 30mins after he arrived asking to sleepover because she was scared he will runaway in the middle of the night. After my mom talked to my sister she contacted me, she asked me to join her to find out what really happened. We arrived at my sister’s place around 7pm, my brother-in-law was the one that opened the door he acted like he did nothing and hugged my mom, then he went to the bedroom with my sister while she was nursing my nephew. I had a gut feeling to see her and when I did she was crying so bad, I noticed he got mad that we arrived and he was getting after my sister because we were there. He probably thought we didn’t know what he did, since he was acting like the usual every time we visit. Cut to the point he wanted to take my nephew away from my sister because she was supposedly dangerous to her son, because she wants to raise him a certain way different from his way and also arguing in front of the kid. He also went on about how he’s being controlled by my sister, since she asked him if he wanted to quit his job and take care of their son while she goes back to work at home about a year ago. They had to give up their one bedroom apartment and move in with my dad since only one was working. Living with my dad did not work so now they’re living in one of my aunts empty house. So now he is blaming my sister for everything they had done, saying that he’s being controlled to always say yes to my sister and that he’s trapped now. So that’s why he wanted to leave and go to Houston to give his son a “ safer” place away from my sister. that night we visited, he wanted my sister out and leave her son there with him and move back into my moms place, even though that house is her family‘s house. At this point after one day later, I don’t know how to feel or help ever since I talked to him. He doesn’t want to acknowledge what he did hurt my sisters feelings and her trust.

Duh, that’s my bro. But when he said thanks really groggily I felt all weird and had to sit down. 

In college we would nap together and stuff but it was totally hetero. Long days of exams do that to you. I never really thought about it further until now.

He also has really nice abs? He is chiseled man. I thought it was just jealousy, you know? Because those abs are totally supposed to be mine. That beard, too. It’s so not fair that he has a 6-pack and perfect definition on his arms and a perfect laugh. It’s like they were carved from stone. I thought he looked good when we were younger too obviously. It’s just really weird to see him so.. defined?

He’s also definitely straight. He never looked at guys when we were growing up or even hinted at finding them attractive. I have spoken about good looking guys in a “I want to look like him” way (obviously) and he never seemed interested in a gay way. If he was I wouldn’t have judged.

She brought up divorce in an argument and asked if I ever thought about it. I said I had but I don’t want it, I think we can work through it and I don’t want my son taken away from me. Even though she brought it up and had clearly been thinking about it, she had been upset with me since because I’ve “clearly been thinking about it” and that’s hurtful. How is that fair?

But the worst at the moment is, any time I try to talk to her she calls up some abstract reason to be upset. I’ll say I think she’s being very hostile what is she annoyed about, and she’ll just say I’m being rude to her. I’ll say how so and she’ll say I just am and it’s not very nice.

My mind keeps telling me that he was following her the entire time trying to stay in touch/keep in contact with her to have her as back up or something in case him and I didn’t work out, and that he only unfollowed her because he found out she was pregnant. I had asked him if she never became pregnant if he would’ve wanted her, even at the time when he was still following her, and he told me “no because even at that point I knew I wanted you.” To me, I unfollow past people I’ve been with. He didn’t unfollow until he knew she was pregnant but claims he didn’t want to rekindle anything even while he was still actively following her and before he found out she was pregnant. Thoughts?

so i have a close friend i made in college. shes really sweet and kind we we met on a very good start. 

i threw a party on friday halloween at my place and invited everyone. bought food drinks etc

we all were drunk happy and having a good time.

a lot of videos were posted mainly of us having a good time and dancing and being funny.


i entered my kitchen and her and another guy friend were dancing sooo funny! they were just hoping and waving their hands up in the air. 
 the girl jumps from one spot to another and yells my guy friends name and looks super fun and drunk and smiles. 

i post all the videos to the groupchat.

i also posted that video on my private friends story as it was so funny and i didnt see any harm. 

apperently they were both annoyed but i talked with the guy and he goes “ya it was funny but we were also drunk and maybe its a violation but i dont care much its whatever she did seem very bothered” the guy later said he didnt care and we hang out and we’re fine

i addressed it to her and she said it was fine. a week later she asks me to delete it from the group chat as well. i do and apologized. she told me she did tell me to remove but i didnt listen. i quickly hugged her and apologized.

Its november 19 and well she has asked me to be her partner for some class that i am struggling with tremendously and shes very good at because she has prior classes beforehand.

we were assigned with 3 assignments. we had to pick her apartment as a study (we are architecture master students) she mesures her apartment with help of some guy. the guy helps and she finishes hw 1.

i have my exes past examples so that will help us a lot.

hw2 she did it alone after i attempted and failed bc i don’t understand the class well.

she shared me the info on thursday and missed a deadline for another class


i kept asking if she needed help and she says she would do it


anyway today i come to find out shes still pissed at me bc of that video. and it will bother her for a while and bothered at the fact that i didnt help her in some assignments as shes stressed and tired.

she keeps saying shes got it so i thought she got it snd since some  guy was helping her i didnt see the need lol",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7595884,public,self,i dont know if im in the wrong or she is,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzzl2g/i_dont_know_if_im_in_the_wrong_or_she_is/,all_ads,6

When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, his two friends started talking about how hot the waitresses were (one of them having a girlfriend at the time). So after we got home I asked if he had ever talked about girls like that with his friends, he didn’t say anything so I stared at him. He then asked “what?” As if he hadn’t heard the question, so I repeated myself and he said no. Fast forward a week later(tonight), I was going through his photos on his phone with him next to me, he tends to screen shot things on accident and just leave the photos there so I was just kinda cleaning them out (we don’t have any issues with each other being and looking through the others phone, as we don’t do it often and when we do it’s not usually to snoop). I saw a screenshot from a Snapchat that said “that’s that sexy chick aye” I asked what that was about and he said “I don’t even know”. I continue to delete that random photos through his phone and then put it down. He could tell I got shitty cause I wasn’t saying anything. I asked “are you going to tell me the truth?” He said “about what” I said “you know what”. He said “it was a message to my boss about his neighbour”. I said nothing and he went on to say that he doesn’t do it all the time. 
Thing is he hangs out a lot with the friend from the pub I mentioned earlier who has a girlfriend and still talks about other women. My boyfriend is very susceptible to ‘peer pressure’ (it’s more like trying to fit in, like no one is pushing him to participate). I tell him that I consider that a form of cheating, and if not that, then in general it’s a really shitty thing to do cause I already have issues with how I look and this just makes me feel not good enough. 

So my question is does anyone consider this cheating? Or a form of ?

anyway my ex and i broke up 5 months
ago. i brought it up as it felt he was
putting me to the side. i thought me
bringing it up would change some things
but all it did was make him agree
he was a bit depressed but id see him do
other things with other people all i wanted
was to sleep next to him etc

we break up and well i beg obviously and
then he starts interacting with me late
june

we meet on our 1 year ( he wanted to) and then hes like
ya i realize we arent meant to be and we fight and i beg and we agree we cant even be friends…
then he comes back on my birthday asking
to add him back on social media
i reach out two more times about school related stuff and everything
is fine

i told myself i wouldnt contact him
anymore but in august he would contact
me about the littlest things
asking if i got the job or asking small
things

he also drunk called me claiming i wasnt
the one but but then he said he missed me
and cried and asked about the gifts he
gave me and said his parents knew me etc
he also blurted out how comfortable he
was with me

after that he would still contact me over
little things
we start school together (masters) and we
are in the same building f

first day of classes he asks to see me and
we see each other
he comes to my section regularly and talks
to me
3 weeks later he becomes my tutor and i
blurt out i dont want to talk him anymore
but we end up talking and i ask him if we

can seriously talk
he agrees but then he cancels

i ask to talk monday and he says hes too
tired to talk about anything and that
theres. nothing to talk about and i actually
get mad
we decide to talk once more (more me
asking) and he cancels saying he is getting
anxiety
i lose it and just get annoyed

2 weeks later its his bday and he texts me
saying he saw my car parked in the
morning and takes a picture of my parking
spot lol
since he contacted me i end up wishing
him

then a week later (3 days ago) he
screenshots someone's story on in. st a g
ram and its a video of me listening to a
friend playing the most beautiful piano
notes
and he goes ""little extra curious liz

and im like yep shes awesome
and he replies ""ya""
and thats it

and thats it

i was so done so i drunk messeged him this 

“bro ur so . annoyin ng. lol and i añ too deunk 😂😂r ight now .. he w tha text

i reply again saying im sorry he says no worries and we just talk about school. he shows me his project and thats that. i see him the next day and he comes towards me and i just wave and go downstairs. i dont go up to him or anything and hes just chilling by my section.

he graduates in december and apperently he went on some trip with a class. havent seen him since … i think hes back but we havent had contact for 2 week… like 2.5 weeks. 

its funny because on monday i was working on my own thing and im in my worst form. haha hair is frizzy hat on coat on. no makeup. he comes next to me and asks how i am i say im good and ask about him. im
working so i dont look at him all the way. and i ask how he is in general and he says he’s graduating in 15 days and i say congratulations and then he says hes gonna be working full time and i say “cool congratulations “ i ask what else is new and thats that. i turn back and look at my computer and he comes in front of me to talk to another guy and i dont look at him at all.

I won’t go too much into the past but i basically have felt like he doesn’t like me back so i decided not to tell him and just get over it 

That being said he did text me something tonight that really confused me, and because there are many occasions where I feel confused I wanted to seek some advice

Before i say the text I’ll provide a little background info. We got close last summer and started hanging out all the time.

We kind of just pick on each other and do random shit, i tell him basically everything and his text responses range from doesn’t read it to random un-inteligible responses to invested, he rarely says serious things but when he needs to talk he talks to me. Also both of us talk about girls/guys regularly and he asks me for advice on girls and i ask him for advice on guys 

Not that he is ever really helpful because he tends to be pretty immature over text in that area  

He is super smart and respectful but in general immature and not always in touch with how he feels 

But if i need him he is there and shows that he cares in other ways 

The first thing that is important to know is that a year ago i told him how i felt, this was over text 

for some reason I said: “i like you in the way that someone would like someone when they like them. ” embarrassing to look back on, he didn’t really respond so I took the non reciprocation as a rejection. 

School passes everything is normal minus my confusion here and there, we graduate 

Summer we talk per usual, then i wish him off to college and we remain in different places but talk as much as normal 

It is now November. Haven’t seen him since august but we text frequently and last week he actually asked to call which has never happened before and then i provided him some advice and we talked for a while 

Tonight we were texting (actually conversationally this time) and he will always randomly text me phrases in other languages (Russian usually) that are just complete nonsense 

Tonight his message was “Говори мне про тебя я люблю” which i translated to mean “Tell me about you, I love you”

Which maybe i’m crazy but i was a little more than confused 

He’s never even said he loved me platonically and uses that word not a lot even 

Why would he send a message like that 

How do i take it

It was a tough summer since she initially said she wanted to go for one year and I said that personally one year was too much for me, after countless fights she decided to stay 6 months, and I’m sure she really meant it then. The distance hasn’t been easy at all on me, we were living together before and now my anxious attachment is constantly activated and my fear of abandonment is at an all time high even though she really is there for me, and I do realise it’s my issue and I was willing to work on it during those first 6 months. Fast forward to when she’s abroad, she hears that she can give more exams here that she could possibly do in her home country, where I also would be, so she’s decided to stay another 4 months, knowing that my limit was 6 and knowing how much I’m struggling already. She also realised since she left that it is easier for her to leave, and has told me that when she comes back she wants to get to therapy to understand some issues about her tendency to be avoidant.

I don’t feel like a priority at all and I feel like I am now still the only idiot desiring our life to go back together in February, because I miss her, I miss doing all the little things.

But from last month,  it was kind of building up inside me. And so today I kind of told her that I needed some time to think about us. As I was getting angrier. It kind of felt like right decision as it will give me opportunity to cool off. As I kept thinking if really wanted to manage she could have done so.

We’ve been dating 5 months but it’s been rocky ever since he lost his job a little over a month ago. He’s been more distant both physically and emotionally and he claims that he can’t open up because he doesn’t know how and I just have to be patient. We built an amazing foundation for our relationship and I love him incredibly and I used to trust him but he has done a few really questionable things:

When we met he gave me access to his phone

I noticed that he follows BDSM accounts on Instagram and just girls that are famous on tiktok for stripping I asked him about it and he said he likes to look at them because they’re attractive but they don’t mean anything to him and he doesn’t consider it porn so to him it’s justified- he said I can look at whatever I want and he refused to delete them

I recently accidentally saw one of the names of these girls I was suspicious of on his Snapchat (BFF) and called him out on it - we had a long rounded discussion where he would not show me his phone before he finally admitted that it was a friend that he slept with a few times and is no longer interested in in that way. He says he deleted her but did not show me so I have no proof. He still follows her on Instagram.

I hope that you did it bc of your career opportunities” He said it in a funny way but deep down inside I take that statement seriously.

He lives in an extended stay motel with his mom. I moved in with them last month and was living in a shelter before rhat. They were living in their car before they got into the motel. Living with them was originally supposed to be temporary until I could afford my own room, but they both want me to stay there with them because if I do, they believe we could all use our income together to find a bigger place of our own. His mom has fibromyalgia so she is on disability and he has back issues so he doesn't have many options for work and has chosen not to work for now because it causes him too much pain. I am the only one who is working full time. 

He has a very strong and firm preference for staying with his mom no matter what, so if I left he would be joining me. He told me once that he feels he'd be abandoning her and is happiest with the idea of us living together. I have been homeless since 2019 and before I moved, I had my own job and was working on saving and getting my credit and everything back together. I have lived with roommates and in shelters, I just want to have a place of my own for once. A place I can decorate and have my own things and actually feel like an adult. 

I care for them both but the situation is suffocating and I feel bad for even wanting to leave. It's not that I have a problem with either of them, it's just that I really wanted my boyfriend and I to have a place of our own, and he doesn't want to do that, so I feel like my next option is getting a place for myself. Living in one room with him and his mom isn't working out for me. I know it's not permanent, but there's no telling how long it'll take for us all to fix our credit and save up enough to rent somewhere else. 

I brought the concern to them both and we talked. I was firm at first and told them I didn't want anyone trying to talk me out of it but after we all talked about it I ended up caving and agreeing to wait it out. They told me they won't be upset if I leave, but they really just want me to wait until we can all get a place together. I just can't escape the fact that I want to have my own space. A friend of his lives at the motel as well and is getting a lump sum and offered to pay a large amount of money to help us move soon, but his mom doesn't want to live with his friend, so they cancelled that, which means it'll be even longer before we find something.

I'm scared to go back on my word and tell them once again that I want to move out. I'm also scared that my boyfriend will break up with me if I do because he has a very strong preference for the three of us staying together. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and I feel bad because they are kind of relying on me to help financially with helping them get out of the motel life and live in an actual house.

TLDR: I want to move into my own room but I'm afraid that it'll hurt my boyfriend and his mom's feelings and also put a strain on our relationship.",True,False,False,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,7595829,public,self,I (22f) Don't Want to Live with My Boyfriend and His Mom,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yzze8t/i_22f_dont_want_to_live_with_my_boyfriend_and_his/,all_ads,6
